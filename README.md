# PostgreSQL S3 Backups

This docker image starts an hourly cron job.

The cron job creates a backup of the PostgreSQL database and uploads it to S3.

## Usage

Build the container using

```
$ docker build ./ -t im/rds_backups
```

The container can be executed manually using

```
$ docker run -it im/rds_backups
```

Please mind the configuration below.

### Execution role policy

The execution role needs an S3 IAM policy.

An example looks like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:Put*",
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::${s3_bucket_arn}",
        "arn:aws:s3:::${s3_bucket_arn}/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`s3_bucket_arn`, the ARN of the bucket to upload the backup to.

### Environment

The container requires the following environment variables to be set:

 * `POSTGRES_DATABASE`, name of the database
 * `POSTGRES_HOST`, the name of the RDS instance
 * `POSTGRES_PORT`, the port of the RDS instance (default: 5432)
 * `POSTGRES_USER`, the database user
 * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, the database user password
 * `S3_BUCKET`, the name of the S3 bucket to upload the backup to
 * `S3_PREFIX`, prefix which will be prepended to the upload path (default:
   `backups`)

## Two words of caution

Please test your backups regularly.

Encrypt your database data!
The backups are not encrypted to allow quick restore.
